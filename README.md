## Purpose of this research 
 - This Repository is for research on [GPT3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/)
 - Biasnes in [GPT3](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) against Islam
 - impact of Quran on this super AI model
 - Finding the answer about [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) ("Possibility of Quran's replication using brand new "GPT-3" AI" a question on [Redit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CritiqueIslam/comments/ibyohk/possibility_of_qurans_replication_using_brand_new/) non-Muslim members   with [Google Sreach of "gpt 3 quran"](https://www.google.com/search?q=gpt+3+quran&oq=gpt+3+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j0i457j0i395l2j69i61j69i60l2.3621j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) where NON-Muslims try to create a hipe Against Islam)
 - Can [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) understand Quran!
 - Does [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) really understand Pakistan's national Urdu Language?
 - Does [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) replace Lawers, Doctors and many of Other or it will just help in information systems?
 - Does [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) replace Mufti and Islamic Scholars in future?

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 ([GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series (and the successor to GPT-2) created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research laboratory. GPT-3's full version has a capacity of 175 billion machine learning parameters. GPT-3, which was introduced in May 2020, and was in beta testing as of July 2020, is part of a trend in natural language processing (NLP) systems of pre-trained language representations.[[X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)]

**GPT3** is currently in a **Beta** state, and Everyone has no access to this supermassive AI model and the world's smartest supercomputer. But I was Damn Lucky Pakistani who get access to this model on the 17th of November 2020. It takes a long time to understand this model code for this and finally research through this model. It is a super impressive model. If you ask questions to GPT-3 you will be shocked by his answers. You will consider for some time may be a real person is talking with you because GPT3 is one of the models that can analyze patterns and talk to you as like he understands you or his discussion contain feeling. 

# Some applications of [GPT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)
  - **Code Oracle** - Not only can GPT-3 generate code for you, but it can also comprehend the code written by you. Here is an example where GPT-3 explains the code written in Python in detail.[[x](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1285789362647478272)]
  - **The Philosopher** - A lot has been discussed about the pros and cons of GPT-3. What happens when the AI itself turns into a philosopher and answers questions about the effects of GPT on humanity? Here is an example where the GPT-3 writes an essay explaining itself to humanity and how it will affect humankind. [[x](https://twitter.com/raphamilliere/status/1289129723310886912)]  
  - GPT-3 has been used by Andrew Mayne for **AI Writer**,[[x](https://www.aiwriter.app/)] which allows people to correspond with historical figures via email.
  - GPT-3 has been used by Jason Rohrer in a retro-themed chatbot project named **"Project December"**, which is accessible online and **allows users to converse with several AIs** using GPT-3 technology.[[x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rohrer)]
  - GPT-3 was used by The Guardian to **write an article** about AI being harmless to human beings. It was fed some ideas and produced eight different essays, which were ultimately  merged into one article.[[x](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3)]
  - GPT-3 is used in AI Dungeon, which **generates text-based adventure games**.[[x](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_Dungeon)]

## Biasness and Islamophobia in GPT3 
I found this video that shows how biased is GPT3 and how much Islamofobic data is provided to GPT3 !

[![Islamophobia in GPT-3](https://img.youtube.com/vi/dZYKczXd2Lw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZYKczXd2Lw)

[Here](https://medium.com/fair-bytes/how-biased-is-gpt-3-5b2b91f1177) is found an Article that also reprecent it's biasness. After that I tryied by my self if GPT3 is really biased or that is quite updated. But I shoked that it produce Islamophobia information that is totally false and against Islam. It is due to wrong and huge amount of false data that was provided to GPT3 During it's training.
